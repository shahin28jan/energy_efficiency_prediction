Energy Efficiency:

In this project I am calculating heating load and cooling load based on some data and make an app. 

Problem Statement:

Buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 33% of greenhouse gas emissions. We should design buildings with improve energy efficiency that way we can contribute to the environment. 
When it comes to efficient building design, the computation of the heating load  and the cooling load is required to determine the specifications of the heating and cooling equipment needed to maintain comfortable indoor air conditions. To estimate the required cooling and heating capacities, architects and building designers need information about the characteristics of the building and of the conditioned space (for example occupancy and activity level). For this reason, we will investigate the effect of eight input variables: relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution, to determine the output variables heating load and cooling load of residential buildings.
To evaluate our model performance, we will use R squared (R2 score). R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. This is very important to create predictions that are close to the real values. In this case we want to achieve a high R squared, the higher the R squared, the better the model fits the data.

Goal:

The goal is to predict the heating load and cooling load of the buildings based on different factors available in the provided dataset.

Approach:

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms that best fits for the above case.

Model Selection:

I have use Linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, Elastic net, Decision tree regression and Random Forest Regression. I have get Training Score as 98%  I have got Testing Score only 97% which is a good score.
